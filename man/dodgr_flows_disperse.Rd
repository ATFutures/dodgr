\usage{
dodgr_flows_disperse(graph, from, dens, wt_profile = "bicycle",
  contract = FALSE, k = 2, heap = "BHeap", quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{\code{data.frame} or equivalent object representing the network
graph (see Details)}

\item{from}{Vector or matrix of points **from** which route distances are to
be calculated (see Details)}

\item{dens}{Vectors of densities correponsing to the \code{from} points}

\item{wt_profile}{Name of weighting profile for street networks (one of foot,
horse, wheelchair, bicycle, moped, motorcycle, motorcar, goods, hgv, psv).}

\item{contract}{If \code{TRUE}, calculate flows on contracted graph before
mapping them back on to the original full graph (recommended as this will
generally be much faster).}

\item{k}{Width coefficient of exponential diffusion function defined as
\code{exp(-d/k)}.  If value of \code{k<0} is given, a standard logistic
polynomial will be used.}

\item{heap}{Type of heap to use in priority queue. Options include
Fibonacci Heap (default; \code{FHeap}), Binary Heap (\code{BHeap}),
\code{Radix}, Trinomial Heap (\code{TriHeap}), Extended Trinomial Heap
(\code{TriHeapExt}, and 2-3 Heap (\code{Heap23}).}

\item{quiet}{If \code{FALSE}, display progress messages on screen.}
}
\value{
Modified version of graph with additonal \code{flow} column added.
}
\description{
Disperse flows throughout a network based on a input vectors of origin points
and associated densities
}
