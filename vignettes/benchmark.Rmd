# Introduction

This vignette contains runtime comparisons for a number of routing
operations between random vertices using distance calculation functions from the
`dodgr` and [`igraph`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=igraph) packages. The
experiments are run using the `compare_heaps()` function, which successively
calls functions `igraph::distances()` and then `dodgr_dists()` with all
implemented options for the `heap` parameter and measures their respecive
runtimes.

The graph data on which the tests are performed are taken from the
[`igraphdata`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=igraphdata) package.
